Islam.io
=====

The Aim of this project is to enable a core data centre that enables API access to all Islamic Knowledge. All information will be added if its from key sources. Data will be reviewed and added legitimately. All will be FREE, no ads or sponsors. This is an independent project, participants are welcome but strictly authenticated data will be allowed. We will all be questioned for our actions starting with me, so no favours, exceptions on data source/centres.

All the Knowledge shared will be Sunnah proof, ie no sources will be shared if its not within the guidelines of Sunnah. Scholars data will be shared with their approval. Any complaints, please send it to me direct.


- Quran
- Hadith
- Scholars
- Quotes
- Knowledge Sources

Along with the above, enable access to the shared data's such as:

- Mosques
- Islamic History
- Islamic Theology
- Islamic Media such as TV and Radios


DATA API Access:

-JSON
-Access Centre will be: 
--api.islam.io/quran/verse/x / /quran/verse/x?english&translator
-- or api.islam.io/hadith/sahih-al-bukhari/all or /volume/x

More information about the datasets will be added here.
