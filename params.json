{"name":"Islamic Data Centre","tagline":"A Global Islamic data access Centre which has json data provided in all formats","body":"Islamic Knowledge Data Centre\r\n=====\r\n\r\nThe Aim of this project is to enable a core data centre that enables API access to all Islamic Knowledge. All information will be added if its from key sources. Data will be reviewed and added legitimately. All will be FREE, no ads or sponsors. This is an independent project, participants are welcome but strictly authenticated data will be allowed. We will all be questioned for our actions starting with me, so no favours, exceptions on data source/centres.\r\n\r\nAll the Knowledge shared will be Sunnah proof, ie no sources will be shared if its not within the guidelines of Sunnah. Scholars data will be shared with their approval. Any complaints, please send it to me direct.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Quran\r\n- Hadith\r\n- Prophets\r\n- Scholars\r\n\r\nAlong with the above, enable access to the shared data's such as:\r\n\r\n- Mosques\r\n- Islamic History\r\n- Islamic Theology\r\n- Islamic Media such as TV and Radios\r\n\r\n\r\nDATA API Access:\r\n\r\n-JSON\r\n-Access Centre will be: \r\n--api.islam.io/quran/verse/x  /quran/verse/x?english&translator\r\n-- or api.islam.io/hadith/sahih-al-bukhari/all or /volume/x\r\n\r\nMore information about the datasets will be added here.\r\n\r\nContributors\r\n\r\nI'm looking for:\r\n- People have good knowledge of setting up server api\r\n- Data Clerics to add data\r\n- Developers to setup providers\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
